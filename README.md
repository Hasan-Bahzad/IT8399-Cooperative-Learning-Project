# 🏢 Enterprise Network Redesign for Multi-Branch Architecture

> A simulated enterprise network redesign featuring Site-to-Site IPsec IKEv2 VPN,
> centralized monitoring, automated backups, and secure multi-branch connectivity — built in EVE-NG.

---

## 📖 Overview

This repository contains the full design, configuration, and documentation of a simulated
**multi-branch enterprise network** built in EVE-NG as part of the IT Capstone Project at
**Bahrain Polytechnic**.

The project redesigns the existing HQ network and extends it to a **new branch** using a
**Site-to-Site IPsec IKEv2 VPN**, with OSPF as the internal routing protocol, centralized
monitoring via **PRTG** and **Graylog**, automated backups using **Ansible**, and identity
management through **Active Directory**. The design prioritizes security, scalability, and
operational efficiency across both sites.

## ✨ Key Features

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **Site-to-Site VPN** | IPsec IKEv2 tunnel between HQ and new branch |
| **Internal Routing** | OSPF for dynamic routing within each site |
| **Static Routes** | Inter-site and gateway-level static routing |
| **Firewall & Security** | Cisco ASA with ACLs and VPN-Filters for traffic control |
| **Network Monitoring** | PRTG for device/performance monitoring, Graylog for log management |
| **Automation** | Ansible playbooks for scheduled configuration backups |
| **Identity Management** | Windows Active Directory with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) |
| **SNMP** | Device polling and trap collection for centralized visibility |
| **Simulation Platform** | EVE-NG with Cisco IOSv, ASA, Linux, and Windows Server images |

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

### Option A — Study & Review
1. Start with the **Network Topology** diagram to understand the overall infrastructure.
2. Read the **Network Design Document** for IP plans, VLAN design, and VPN architecture.
3. Browse device configs to understand how IPsec, OSPF, ACLs, and VPN-Filters interact.
4. Review Ansible playbooks to understand the backup automation workflow.

### Option B — Lab Reproduction
1. Install and launch **EVE-NG** (Community or Pro).
2. Import `Enterprise-Network.unl` into your EVE-NG lab folder.
3. Assign the correct **Cisco IOSv**, **ASA**, **Linux**, and **Windows Server** images.
4. Boot devices and load configs from the `Configurations/` folder.
5. Deploy Ansible on the Linux server and run the playbooks.
6. Configure PRTG and Graylog using the setup guides in `Monitoring/`.
7. Verify the network using the commands below.
